Empath AI

The First Intent-Aware Music Production AI
Hum a melody. Get a full arrangement. Directly in your DAW.

Overview

Empath AI is an AI-powered music production tool that transforms a hummed melody into a harmonically intelligent, multi-track MIDI arrangement — delivered directly into your DAW.

Unlike basic pitch-to-MIDI tools, HumTrack understands musical intent, emotion, and structure, not just notes.

Designed for independent producers, beatmakers, and FL Studio users, HumTrack reduces the workflow from idea → arrangement from 40–120 minutes down to under 45 seconds.

🚀 Key Features

🎙 Hum-to-MIDI Pipeline – Record 5–30 seconds of melody via microphone

🎼 Intent & Emotion Analysis – Detects key, BPM, mood, and melodic contour

🎹 Automatic Chord Generation – Harmonically intelligent chord progressions

🎧 Optional Audio Preview – 30-second backing track preview

🎛 Multi-Track MIDI Output – Melody + chords delivered to DAW

💬 Natural Language Refinement – “Make this darker”, “Add tension”, etc.

🔒 Fully Offline & Private – No cloud dependency

🧠 Open-Source AI Stack – No API lock-in
